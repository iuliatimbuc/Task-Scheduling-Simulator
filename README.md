# Task-Scheduling-Simulator

Task Scheduling Simulator is a Java-based simulation tool that models how tasks are distributed across multiple servers using different scheduling strategies.  
The application includes a graphical user interface (GUI) and provides real-time visualization of queues, waiting times, service times, and system performance.

The simulation generates random tasks and dispatches them to servers based on one of the following strategies:

- **Shortest Queue Strategy** the server with the smallest number of tasks
- **Shortest Time Strategy**  the server with the shortest estimated waiting time
